## 📖 What is The Everything Translator?

The Everything Translator is a tool designed to help you translate not just languages like English to Spanish, but also encrypted formats such as Morse code and binary — without the need for an internet connection.

Even in 2025, there are situations where you might not have access to the internet. That’s why we created The Everything Translator. Now, you can encrypt and decrypt messages anywhere, anytime — fully offline.

## 🛠️ What Does It Do?

The Everything Translator currently supports:

- ✅ Binary ➡️ ASCII
- ✅ ASCII ➡️ Binary
- ✅ Morse ➡️ ASCII
- ✅ ASCII ➡️ Morse

We are also planning to add support for more encodings and alphabets in the future.

## 🚀 How to Use

There is no official release yet, but you can run the app using Python in your terminal.

    python main.py

Run this command in the root directory of the project.

However, before that, you need to install the required libraries:

    pip install tk

json and os are built-in libraries in Python, so you don’t need to install them separately.

Once done, enjoy your translator!
